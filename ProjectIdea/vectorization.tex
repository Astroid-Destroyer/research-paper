\subsection{Vectorization}

The neural networks train or operate on vectorized data. \cite{InfosysNLP:1} Word2vec NN is used to convert text into a numerical format by vectorizing the words of the input text. (i.e.,) the input to Word2Vec is always a text and the output of Word2Vec is a set of vectors.

It is one such model which constructs a distributed representation of the input words.
Gensim is a popular open-source NLP library used for vectorization.
