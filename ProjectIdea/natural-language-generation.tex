\subsection{Natural Language Generation}

Natural Language Generation, otherwise known as NLG, is a software process driven by artificial intelligence that produces natural written or spoken language from structured and unstructured data. It helps computers to feed back to users in human language that they can comprehend, rather than in a way a computer might.
