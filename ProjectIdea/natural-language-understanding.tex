\subsection{Natural Language understanding}

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is the ability of a computer to understand human language. The most basic form of NLU is parsing, which takes text written in natural language and converts it into a structured format that computers can understand. Parsing is only one part of NLU; other tasks include sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and semantic role labeling.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parsing:} Converts natural language into structured data.
    \item \textbf{Sentiment analysis:} Identifies the emotional tone of a text.
    \item \textbf{Entity recognition:} Detects named entities like people, organizations, and locations.
    \item \textbf{Semantic role labeling:} Determines the role of words in a sentence.
\end{itemize}
